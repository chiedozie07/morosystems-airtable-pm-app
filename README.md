# MoroSystems Project Management App
This is a custom React web application built for the MoroSystems for No Code/Low Code Workflow AI Automation Full-Stack Engineer technical assessment. The app is a front-end client designed to connect with an Airtable base, providing a dynamic and visual way to manage projects. It serves as a complementary interface to the Airtable backend, displaying key project data in an intuitive, color-coded dashboard.

## Features
1. Dynamic Data Display: The application fetches and displays project records directly from the Airtable "Projects" table.

2. Real-time Updates: The app automatically updates to reflect any changes made in the Airtable base, including new records, status changes, and data edits.

3. Color-Coded Status: Project cards are visually highlighted with a color that corresponds to their status (Not Started, In Progress, Blocked, Done), allowing for quick visual scanning.

4. Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive and optimized for a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Airtable Setup
This application requires a connected Airtable base to function. The project is designed to integrate with the "Planning Base" configured as part of the technical assessment.

## Key Tables & Fields
The app specifically relies on data from the Projects table. Ensure the following fields are present and correctly configured in your Airtable base:

- Project Name

- Start Date

- End Date

- Project Status

- Assignee

- Reporter

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)

- bnpm (v9 or higher)

- An Airtable account with a base set up according to the project assessment.

### Tech Stack
- Frontend Framework: Javascript/Typescript
- React.js + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Routing: react-router-dom
- Global State Management: React context API/Redux Toolkit

### 1. Clone the Repository
[Repository URL,](https://github.com/chiedozie07/morosystems-airtable-pm-app.git)

```

### 3. Configure the Airtable API
The app connects to your Airtable base using a configuration file. You need to create a .env.local file in the root of your project with the following

### Environment Variables Setup:
```
VITE_AIRTABLE_API_KEY=YOUR_AIRTABLE_API_KEY
VITE_AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=YOUR_AIRTABLE_BASE_ID
VITE_AIRTABLE_TABLE_ID=YOUR_AIRTABLE_TABLE_ID

YOUR_AIRTABLE_API_KEY: Your personal API key from the Airtable Developer Hub.

YOUR_AIRTABLE_BASE_ID: The ID of your "Planning Base." You can find this in the URL when you are in your base.

YOUR_AIRTABLE_TABLE_ID: The ID of your "Projects" table.
```
